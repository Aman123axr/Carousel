# Carousel

Approach:

Selects DOM elements for images, dots, left and right arrows.
Initializes variables for the current image index and the time interval for automatic sliding.
Defines a function (defClass) to hide/show images based on the provided index.
Sets up event listeners for left and right arrow clicks to navigate through images.
Implements an automatic sliding function (startAutoSlide) using setInterval.
Calls startAutoSlide to begin automatic sliding when the page loads.
